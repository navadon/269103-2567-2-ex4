2.chmod (change the permission of folders and directories)
Enginneers have to set up permissions and accesss for different types of users in the organiztion to make the system secure

2. After one and a half years in the ISNE program, what advice would you give to prospective ISNE students? (Minimum 50 words)

**Answer:** 
I think one and a half years mean our 4th sem, so at that time , we would have survied the hell sem of ISNE.
I want to say to the prospective students that think again before u enroll in this major, not meaning the major is not good, it is kinda difficult that some of my friends even didn't make it and leave on the half way.
So, it will be waste of time if u are not sure and not decicated enough to withstand the pressure.
